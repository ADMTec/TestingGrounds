## Introduction
A basic first-person shooter made in Unreal Engine 4. The player will have to sneak past all enemies to proceed onward. If they are detected then they must defeat all enemies instead to proceed onward.

#### Compared to BattleTank this project will expand on:
* Enemy AI
* A more in-depth world
* A "win" state for each room/section (when spotted the room locks, when all enemies are defeated the room opens)
